<h3 align="center">Manual of Google Dorking tool</h3>

## ‚ùì ¬øHow it works?
Well it starts with the function that it's ***make_search*** So it does the normal Google search. You can do a normal search like: *YouTube, Instagram, Facebook* 

**Example:**

![Screenshot](images_manual/mk_search.png)

and it will give you results with their ***titles, descriptions and links*** And it also works with special Google operators like: **intext, intitle, filetype**, and others.

You must define the number of **Results**, the **File** to save this Results given.

## üîç Search_Dork function
**How does it work?**
This function is made of to make this *advanced searches* through Google Search and it does with the **commands** I made like:

- ***doc***: it converts to **filetype**
- ***rel***: it converts to **related**
- ***pass***: it converts to a long list of such keywords of passwords (**pass, password, clave, admin_password, etc...**)

**Example:**

### üîó About the `&` separator

When combining multiple commands, always separate them using `&`.  
This character tells the tool where one command ends and another begins.

‚úÖ Correct: `descr="password"&docs`  
‚ùå Incorrect: `descr="password" docs` ‚Üê This will cause an error.

You will see it in the next explinations and examples...

---

and the function Search_Dork does that **if detects that commands automatically** it will convert this commands *to operators of google* and pass it to the **make_search** function to perform the search with these converted operators.

**¬øWhy?**
well because I realize that are more tools that give you a long list of these operators of google, and that's great ***but*** it's annoying and tedious doing put these searches one by one, And it also takes a lot of time to do these searches, especially if it is very specific and requires a long list of these operators and that's why I made this **search_dork** function.

---

### üìë There are two types of commands for the function search_dork

These commands are ***üîç command_search*** and ***üî® special_command***

The **command_search** It is made to be assigned a **specific value** like:

- **site**: it converts to ***site*** operator.
- **url**: it converts to ***inurl*** operator.
- **descr**: it converts to ***intext*** operator.

So for **example** if you put ***descr*** in the search it's **necessary to to complete it with =""**, and it would *look* something like this: ***descr=""***

**¬øWhat goes inside the quotation marks?**

you put the value whatever you want so for **example** again let's make it like this: ***descr="phone"*** and the function It will convert it to:

*intext:phone*

**Example:**

![Screenshot](images_manual/ex_cmd_sch.png)

***disclaimer***: you always need to close the **quotation marks** or else it's gonna display an error.

**Example:**

![Screenshot](images_manual/ex1_err_sch.png)

### üìù Now the special_command

It's a bunch of commands that are made to be **converted to a long list of values** like:

- **pass**: it converts to a list of ***passwords***
- **adr**: it converts to a list of ***address***
- **keys**: it convert to a list of ***api-keys***


So if you make a search using this two different commands: ***command_search***, and ***special_command*** so let's make an example using this two commands:

***descr="passwords"&docs***

Would look something like this:

![Screenshot](images_manual/ex_two_cmds.png)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Attention
Im going to mention that the command ***doc*** and the command ***docs*** aren't the same thing.

***Explination:***

In case you need a file in specific, or a few ones, you can use the **doc** command instead of using the **docs** command that gives you the whole list of files.

The command **doc** is a **command_search** so that means that the **doc** command **need a specific value** something like pdf, txt, etc... and it would look like this:

***doc="pdf"***

***And the (docs) commands*** is a **special_command** that gives you the *whole list of files* so you need to type only **docs**.

## üóíÔ∏è The multi_search function

The **multi_search** function it's where you can do ***multiple searches*** using the **search_dork function** at the same time.

**¬øWhat does mean?**

It means that you can use the **search_dork function multiple times**.

**How it works?**

All you need it's to put the **amount** of multiple searches that you want, and this function ***store this amount of multiple searches*** in a list, once you finished to put this searches, the ***function automatically will perform this searches*** one by one.

**Example:**

And that's it, if you don't know where is the multiple searches just go to:

***8 Google Dorking > 7 (custom) > 2 (Multiple Searches)*** 

And now, you can perform the amount of searches that you want...

If you don't know the commands, you should check the Explination of **Search_Dork function** that was given from ***above.*** (^-^)
