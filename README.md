## ❓ What is SpyNexus?

**SpyNexus** is an open-source **OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)** toolkit built in Python, designed for:

* 🛡️ Cybersecurity enthusiasts
* 🧠 Ethical hackers
* 🕵️ Digital investigators
* 📰 Cyber journalists

It combines multiple tools to gather **public intelligence** from different sources — **legally and ethically**.

---

## 🧰 Features (Tools)

1. 🌐 Track your current IP
2. 🖥️ Search public IPs
3. 🌍 Get info from a website (WHOIS)
4. 📱 Track phone numbers
5. 🗺️ Search coordinates or places
6. 👤 Search users on various sites
7. 🖼️ Extract metadata from images
8. 🔍 Google Dorking (with custom commands)
9. 🎩 Deep Search (deep/dark web engines)

## 🔐 New Feature: Tor Support for the most Tools of SpyNexus

When using **Google Dorking**, or another tool. Now allows you to choose:

* 🌐 **Standard connection (requests)**
* 🕳️ **Anonymous connection via Tor (SOCKS5 proxy)**

You can select this **before each search**, and the connection will be handled accordingly.

Also you need to open a **new terminal** and start a new tor connection. ***How to do it?***

### 🔨 Installation & initiation of the Tor Network
first, you need to verify if your terminal is **updated**
```
sudo apt update && apt upgrade -y
```
Once done you can type:
```
sudo apt install tor -y
```
Once the installation is **finished you can start a new terminal**
and start, just typing **"tor"** and doing enter.

**Example:**

Once it says **"done"** at the end of the terminal.

**Now you can use the Tor feature in SpyNexus!**

### 🔸 Advantages of Tor connection

* 🕵️ Hides your real IP address
* 🧱 Helps bypass regional restrictions
* 🧬 Increases anonymity during recon tasks
* 🌎 Useful for journalists and sensitive research

### 🔻 Disadvantages of Tor connection

* 🐢 Slower than standard connection
* ❌ Some Google results may be blocked or require CAPTCHA
* 🔌 Requires Tor running in the background (port `9050`)
